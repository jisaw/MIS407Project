<h1>MIS407Project</h1>
=============

<h2>Data analytics project for MIS 407</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this project for Advanced Business Programming our team will scrape data for resturants and bars around the Ames, IA area for special promotions and deals and then use that information to determine which places offer the best "bang for you buck" for each night of the week.</p>
<br>
<p>Our end goal with this project is to be able to compare special offers with normal prices of all of the locations that we monitor and produce a statistical approach to saving money in college. We aim to produce the best $ to item price per night as well as wether it is cheaper to go out to drink or eat that night. We also aim to show which reasturants are offering the best deals in relation to their regular pricing.</p>
<br>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>For this project we have divided up the tools we need into three catagories. These catagories are data mining, data analytics, and data visualisation</p>
